### IEEE Programming Competition Practice Problems

[Lion Territory Problem](https://csacademy.com/ieeextreme-practice/task/15443fc9f89feb90bc30096f43b308af/)

Given the numbers that define a group of lions, where their located on a grid, and their territorial reach, calculate the lion that is on the most number of territories.

lion.py contains code, written and visual explanations of the scenario depicted with by the data provided in the sample input.

Referring to that, drawing out the grid yourself, should help to identify the solution. This exposure should prepare you to solve similar problems in the future.
